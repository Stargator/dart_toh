# Test Configuration

# This is a browser-only package, so test on content shell by default.
platforms: [dartium]

# Determines that platform our tests will run on
test_on: "browser || vm" # Essentially all browsers and command line on Windows, Mac, and Linux

# This boolean field controls whether or not stack traces are chained. Disabling stack trace chaining will improve
# performance for heavily asynchronous code at the cost of debuggability.
chain_stack_traces: false

# This package's tests are fine. The default timeout.
timeout: "none"

# This boolean field controls whether or not stack traces caused by errors are trimmed to remove internal stack frames.
# This includes frames from the Dart core libraries, the stack_trace package, and the test package itself.
# It defaults to false.
verbose_trace: true

# This boolean field controls whether or not stack traces caused by errors that occur while running Dart compiled to JS
# are converted back to Dart style. This conversion uses the source map generated by dart2js to approximate the original
# Dart line, column, and in some cases member name for each stack frame. It defaults to false.
js_trace: false

# This field controls whether or not tests are skipped. It's usually applied to specific tags rather than used at the top level. Like the skip parameter for test(), it can either be a boolean indicating whether the tests are skipped or a string indicating the reason they're skipped.
tags:
  # Tests that are run with the Ahead of Time (AOT) compiler (ie: All AngularDart tests)
  aot:

  # Tag for any tests that need a browser
  browser:

  # Integration tests are fine, so use default timeout again.
  integration: {timeout: 1x}

  # Sanity tests are quick and verify that nothing is obviously wrong. Declaring
  # the tag allows us to tag tests with it without getting warnings.
  sanity:
    retry: 2 # Determines number of retries for a test

  ie:
    skip: "IE is not officially supported"

# Runner Configuration

reporter: expanded

# This field applies configuration when specific operating systems are being used.
on_os:
  windows:

  mac-os:

  linux:

# Indicates the filename pattern that the test runner uses to find test files in directories
# It defaults to "*_test.dart"
filename: "*_test.dart"

# Paths the Test Runner will find test files
# It defaults to test/
paths:
- test/
- lib/
